# Genealogical research site of the family Vonjahr

A genealogy site for the family Vonjahr. Some information about the austrian part of the family Vonjahr.

Especially concerning the coat of arms that exists in different variations but there is no hint of the origin.

An interesting part is that Jean-Jacques Foignard went from Hessen to austria and changed his name to Jakob Vonjahr.

Probably the family itself came from spanish Netherlands in the 17th century.
